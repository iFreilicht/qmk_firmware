# iFreilicht's custom keymap for xd75

This keymap offers a split layout based on the US-International layout.
It requires the layout "US-INTL" (with dead keys) to be selected in OS. 
The dead keys are "revived" to be used exactly like non-dead keys, similar to how linux
handles the "AltGr dead keys" variant of the layout. They can still be accessed via the FN layer.

The layout also includes a full Colemak DH layer.

The "Num Mode Lock" and "Game Mode Lock" buttons are implemented as Locking MX switches on my board.
If you want to use regular switches, change the respective instances of `MO()` to `TG()` before compiling.
